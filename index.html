                This is a club that I have been a part of since my Junior year. I had always acted as the treasurer of student organizations, but I wanted to do so for an actual club instead of housing sections. I found Cardinal Eats as a suitable choice due to my intrests and their need for a treasurer. I found the club in dire need to some assistance, as the former treasurer had made lots of mistakes when it comes to the budget of the club. I have been able to patch a lot of these problems over the past year by organizing fundraising opportunities and talking with the student government at Iowa State to procure more funding to printe the magazine.

                I have since become the President of the club and am very ambitious about the contributions I will be making to the future of the club. I want to increase the collaboration between the club and the school newspaper, The Iowa State Daily. I also want to get the magazine we produce to be more accessible online and extra content such as videos and recipies to also be shown on a website. I am very optimistic for the future and what the club will evolve into.
